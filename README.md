[React](https://reactjs.org/) (React.js / ReactJS) is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It is used for building reusable UI components. React is a library for building composable user interfaces, it supports and encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which presents data that changes over time by using declarative syntax.

![Redux](https://i.imgur.com/bdZA5Ie.png)

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
